# 🏗 evolution-DAO

DAO development learning project that makes 3 different DAOs with increasing difficulty level

- **Khazi** (DAO with one vote per address)
- **Khazum** (DAO with ERC20 for votes)
- **Khazerium** (DAO + ERCVotes + mint NFT to proposal executor)
- **Khazathon** (quadratic DAO + NFT2executor + dynamic NFT given **optionally** for voters)

## Pending changes

- Add functionality to buttons (maybe with the help of update-frontend from hardhat)
- Test Khazi works as intended
- Add ERC20 for votes to Khazum
- Write tests

## Later changes

- Make a nicer frontend
- Config docker/package.json to make the express server run on deploy to surge
- Config express, createProposal and .jsx elements to read dynamically abi and address based on chainId
- Update frontend dynamically when a new proposal is posted (express?)

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

🚨 If you are using a version < v18 you will need to remove `openssl-legacy-provider` from the `start` script in `package.json`

> 1️⃣ clone/fork 🏗 evolution-DAO:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/evolution-DAO.git
```

> 2️⃣ install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd evolution-DAO
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> 3️⃣ in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

🚨 if your contracts are not deployed to localhost, you will need to update the default network in `App.jsx` to match your default network in `hardhat-config.js`.

```bash
cd evolution-DAO
yarn start
```

> 4️⃣ in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

🚨 if you are not deploying to localhost, you will need to run `yarn generate` first and then fund the deployer account. To view account balances, run `yarn account`. You will aslo need to update `hardhat-config.js` with the correct default network.

```bash
cd evolution-DAO
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

🚨📡 To deploy to a public domain, use `yarn surge`. You will need to have a surge account and have the surge CLI installed. There is also the option to deploy to IPFS using `yarn ipfs` and `yarn s3` to deploy to an AWS bucket 🪣 There are scripts in the `packages/react-app/src/scripts` folder to help with this.`
