# üê£ evolution-DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are self-governing entities that operate on the blockchain. They are designed to operate without a central authority and rely on smart contracts to make decisions.

evolution-DAO is a DAO development repo for building different DAOs with increasing difficulty.
